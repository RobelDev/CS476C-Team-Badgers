				<h2>Project Overview</h2>
				<p>
					For this project, we would like to create a powerful, flexible badging system that can be used both throughout our company and within individual work groups. Specifically, we envision a secure internal web application where employees can easily acknowledge the skills and accomplishments of others, while also proudly displaying the kudos or awards that they have received; this could also serve as a sort of virtual resume for the skills and successes they have attained.
